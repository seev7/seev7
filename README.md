- 👋 Hi, I’m @seev7. I've been coding since I was 10 or 11. I've spent most of my time creating web and desktop applications that tens of thousands of people have used. 

  In the past I've created entire businesses off of
selling licensed desktop and web applications (licensing systems which I built from scratch) which peaked at hundreds to thousands of daily users. 

  I'm best in languages like C#, Java, and PHP. I'm able to do languages like Python or Javascript, but those are usually not my <b>goto;</b> (sorry)
  
  For database technologies, coming from experience with PHP, I am most proficient in MySQL. 
I have dabbled in some MongoDB though, and I would have no problem picking it up. I've also created production apps with javascript libraries such as React along with Node.js/Express.

  I am eager to learn the best and cutting edge ways of doing things and I believe I am very adaptable to new technologies. 
    
    I am majoring in college for computer science. Surprise.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in creating and studying useful and pragmatic software of both operating system level and application level development. I love the inner workings of software and computer science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web-based technologies including but not limited to React, AWS/cloud computing, multi-purpose web apps, and also getting my feet wet in other useful and logical programming paradigms like functional programming
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate or potentially lead projects with any potential that are based on languages such as C++, C#, Java
- 📫 How to reach me ... cellognis@gmail.com for any potential opportunities or business inquiries... Just don't ask me to center a DIV. Still figuring that one out.
